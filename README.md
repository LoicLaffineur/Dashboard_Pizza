# 🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a full end‑to‑end Business Intelligence analysis based on one year of sales data from a fictional pizzeria.  
It follows the well‑known dataset used in the *Data Tutorials* YouTube channel and demonstrates my ability to build a complete BI solution: data preparation, SQL modeling, KPI definition, and dashboard design in Power BI.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze one year of pizza sales and provide clear business insights to help the restaurant understand:

- Revenue performance  
- Customer ordering behavior  
- Best‑selling and worst‑selling products  
- Sales trends by day, month, category, and size  
- Operational KPIs for decision‑making  

The final dashboard allows stakeholders to quickly identify growth opportunities and optimize menu strategy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI Desktop** – Data modeling, DAX, dashboard design  
- **PostgreSQL** – Database creation, SQL queries, KPI calculations  
- **SQL** – Data cleaning, aggregation, and analytical queries  
- **Excel/CSV** – Source dataset  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project documentation  

## 🧩 Data Model

The dataset contains detailed information about each pizza order:

- Order ID  
- Pizza name and category  
- Size  
- Quantity  
- Unit price and total price  
- Order date and time  
- Ingredients  

## 📈 Key KPIs

The following metrics were computed using SQL and Power BI:

- **Total Revenue**  
- **Total Orders**  
- **Total Pizzas Sold**  
- **Average Order Value**  
- **Average Pizzas per Order**  
- **Top 5 Best‑Selling Pizzas**  
- **Top 5 Worst‑Selling Pizzas**  
- **Revenue by Category and Size**  
- **Orders by Day and Month**

Example SQL snippet:

```sql
-- Total Revenue
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue
FROM pizzas;

-- Average Order Value
SELECT SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS avg_order_value
FROM pizzas;
```
